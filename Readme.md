### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I prioritezed the architecture, modularity and seperation of components of the code. If the project is set in the correct form from the beginning it will be easier to manager later and have a better quality.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
Around 6 hours. I worked on it on different days spent around 1 each on those days. Worked on different modules.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I focused more on networking and making modulized components more rather than UI itself.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
UI could be better and Unit tests. There is no pagination for loading recipes so if we recive a big junk of data that can be an issue.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
I have used SwiftUI's new Testing. Which I haven't used before. If i spent more time on it could make it better.
